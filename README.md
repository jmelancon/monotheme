plugins:
  - jemoji # used for emojis. use them with normal GitHub markdown syntax, like this :smile:
```

Also, be sure to add the following to the top of each markdown file in your site:

```
---
layout: page
title: Home
desc: Debug home page. Text here for meta description.
permalink: /
importance: -1
---
```

Of note is title, desc, and importance. `title` is the title of the page. This will appear in the `<title>` tag. `desc` is used for the `<meta name="description">` tag for SEO purposes. `importance` can be the same for each page, however, if you would like to sort your pages in the mobile and desktop navigation areas, using a larger importance number will make the object appear lower on the list.  

To use favicons, put your ```favicon.ico``` in the root directory of your repository.

Any page with a title will be included in the site's sitemap.xml.
